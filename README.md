# Hot Topic Retail Breach | Threat Intelligence Briefing

This project delivers a concise executive threat intelligence report and slide briefing on the 2024 Hot Topic retail breach involving ~350 million customer records. The analysis examines how third-party vendor access, infostealer malware, and weak privileged identity controls likely enabled unauthorized access to cloud systems including Snowflake and Azure. The work translates technical findings into leadership-level risk context.

The briefing identifies core control gaps across MFA enforcement, vendor access governance, endpoint protection, and monitoring. It concludes with prioritized recommendations across identity security, zero trust architecture, cloud segmentation, and continuous threat monitoring. The deliverable demonstrates applied threat intelligence analysis, third-party risk reasoning, and executive communication skills.
